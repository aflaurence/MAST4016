Task 4.1
Very clear introduction slides, with good use of bullet points. Good choice of font and point size.

Task 4.2
Clear slides: glad you kept both histograms on the same slide as that makes it much easier to compare.
I probably wouldn't include the section numbers in the title, unless there was a need for the audience to track back to the original report.
