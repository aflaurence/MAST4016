Task 4.1
A clear Introduction slide, with  good use of bullet points and appropriate point size. 
I wonder if the order of the bullet points needs to be changed as you would probably introduce the term Parkrun first.
Good use of background/font colours in the table.

Task 4.2
You were right to keep the histograms on the same slide to ease the comparison.
I probably wouldn't use the figure numbers in the slides (unless of course the reason for doing so
was to allow the audience to track back to the report).

Task 4.3
Clear use of bullet points in the Conclusion slide.
I like the way you used a larger point size for the conclusion points to give them greater emphasis.
