Task 4.1
Catchy title!
Introduction slide uses a clear font with appropriate point size and clear bullet points.

Task 4.2
Clear main body slides. Good that you kept the two histograms on the same slide to make it easy to compare.
Were you planning to present the means and standard deviations? You refer to them on the Conclusion slide.

Task 4.3
Would be better to use the title 'Conclusion'.
Again, an interesting picture and I can see why the point size needs to be small so the picture does not make it hard to read. With 
more time, you could resolve this, I'm sure.
