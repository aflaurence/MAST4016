Task 4.1
Good choice of font and point size.
I suspect you would refer to the term 'Parkrun' very early on as you speak about this slide, so maybe move that explanation earlier.
Be careful about the explanation of the data collection: the times were the fastest male and female finishers for each of 230 races (not a random selection
of finshers). You don't really need the second bullet point about equipment here - it's more for the audience to read from the slide and probably can 
be assumed.
Under classification, I'm not sure to what the second bullet point refers (as this is an introductory slide setting the context) and 
how the third bullet point applies to the data we have.
Most of these comments are about the content - with longer to consider the data, I am sure they would have been corrected. For future presentations, present
the facts rathers than creating additional detail.

Task 4.2
I like the interest added to the slides using the yellow band; just be careful that other objects do not cover up anything you add unless you intend 
them to do so.
On the first slide, I'd remove the bullet in front of 'Summary of the Data'. Good font and point size and clear use of dark background/light font in the table.
On slides 2 and, you would probably omit the figure number if you were producing the slides from scratch. Good, clear slides.

Task 4.3 - not uploaded.
