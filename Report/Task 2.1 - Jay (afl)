You have included most of the relevant information.
Be careful about your punctuation and grammar, e.g. 'runner's times'.
I am very happy with the comment in the final sentence about seeing the changes in times, 
but be careful about how the reader might interpret 'runner expereinces'. You might not have the data to provide information
on those.
You could usefully add information on the structure of the report, e.g. in section 2 we will ...... and so on.
