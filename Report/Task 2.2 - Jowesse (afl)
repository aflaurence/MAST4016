You've captured the key points in your summary, but make sure you proof read your text carefully for spelling and punctuation errors when you
write a report for real.
Given the language in the main body of the report, you could use the term 'less variable' rather than 'less spread out'.
I probably wouldn't refer to the figure numbers here as this summarises the message the reader should take away with them and
knowing the figure number is not relevant.
